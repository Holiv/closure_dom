# Closures - DOM Manipulation 
-------
### Using Closure with a Self Invoked Function

[Read the code here](./closures.js)

Notes about Closures:

- A self invoked function is a function that is executed imediataly and can have as a parameter another function.
- The inner function can be a function that will not execute at the time of the Self Invoked Function is called. A event listener for example.
- The Closure allows the inner function to be executed even after the self invocked function is already pulled off from the stack
